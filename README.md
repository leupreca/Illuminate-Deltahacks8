# Illuminate - Deltahacks 8

Created by Anisha Vatti, Emily Perica, Sophia Aslanidis and Anna Leuprecht

# Inspiration

Determined to create a project that was able to make impactful change, we sat and discussed together as a group our own lived experiences, thoughts, and opinions. We quickly realized the way that the lack of thorough sexual education in our adolescence greatly impacted each of us as we made the transition to university. Furthermore, we began to really see how this kind of information wasn't readily available to female-identifying individuals (and others who would benefit from this information) in an accessible and digestible manner. We chose to name our idea 'Illuminate' as we are bringing light to a very important topic that has been in the dark for so long.

# What it does

This application is a safe space for women (and others who would benefit from this information) to learn more about themselves and their health regarding their sexuality and relationships. It covers everything from menstruation to contraceptives to consent. The app also includes a space for women to ask questions, find which products are best for them and their lifestyles, and a way to find their local sexual health clinics. Not only does this application shed light on a taboo subject but empowers individuals to make smart decisions regarding their bodies.

# How we built it

Illuminate was built using Flutter as our mobile framework in order to be able to support iOS and Android. We learned the fundamentals of the dart language to fully take advantage of Flutter's fast development and created a functioning prototype of our application.

# What's next for Illuminate

In the future, we hope to add an interactive map component that will be able to show users where their local sexual health clinics are using a GPS system.

# How to access Illuminate

The complete program can be found via lib > main.dart
